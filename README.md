Recommendations

2.	International Plans Incentives:
•	Customers without international plans seem to have higher churn rates. Consider providing targeted incentives or promotions to encourage customers to subscribe to international plans. This could involve discounted rates, special offers, or additional benefits for international calling.
3.	Customer Engagement Strategies:
•	Recognizing that total day minutes and total evening minutes significantly affect churn rates, implement customer engagement strategies during these periods. This could involve targeted communication, special offers, or loyalty programs designed to keep customers engaged and satisfied.
4.	Geographical Targeting:
•	Given that certain states (e.g., Texas, New Jersey) have higher churn rates, explore region-specific retention strategies. This might involve understanding regional preferences, addressing localized issues, or tailoring promotions to better meet the needs of customers in those areas.
